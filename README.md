# TilemapGodot
repository for Godot Asset

The user inputs the size of the map, the sprite of the tiles, and the number of tile. The asset then generates a random map each time the user calls its funtion.

Instructions:
The asset is an entire godot scene that already have a map with tiles as an example. To change it you must create your own tilemap and edit the script.
